# Touch Leaves

An autumn-themed grass touching simulator inspired by Discord's "The Last Meadow"

This is a PWA, meaning you can download it and play offline!

Touch leaves to buy all the upgrades that give you more leaves or improve the visual experience!
Will you be able to return to your computer before autumn ends?
